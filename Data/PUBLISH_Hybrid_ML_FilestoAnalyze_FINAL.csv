I found the bird perched in a thicket at about head height, where it continued to vocalize a bit; it only stayed a few minutes, then it went out of sight (I think around the corner).  Song seems to me to be a version of Spotted.  Abutter said bird has been at private, inaccessible feeder (which is not visible from road) for couple of weeks.  Abutter is very nice but seems to desire privacy; please respect.  Thanks to Sean Williams, Marshall Iliff, and Jan Smith for their help with the ID!  Some notes from them: The white spots on the back and coverts (though seems a bit muted) are good for Spotted, while the white bases to the primaries (though muted) are good for Eastern. So it's a pretty classic-looking hybrid. The white wing check needs to be absent for it to be a pure Spotted since that trait is only found in Eastern and tends to be dominant such that it appears on all f1 hybrids.",Pipilo maculatus x erythrophthalmus,x00446,Hybrid,32748,NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA
